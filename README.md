# LLM RAG Applications

This is a collection of simple applications/code snippets that demonstrates the use of a LLM with a Retrieval-Augmented Generator (LLM RAG) for text generation tasks. This uses most of the popular
LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama-2

## Overview

LLM RAG is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of a language model with retrieval-based methods to generate text responses. This application showcases how to use LLM RAG for various text generation tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation.

## Features

- **Question Answering:** Utilize the LLM RAG model to answer questions based on provided context.
- **Summarization:** Generate summaries of text passages using LLM RAG.
- **Dialogue Generation:** Engage in conversational exchanges by leveraging the LLM RAG model.
