This includes an increase of 18% in Productivity and Business Processes revenue, 25% in Intelligent Cloud revenue, and 10% in More Personal Computing revenue. Gross margin also increased by $19.8 billion, with a slight decrease in gross margin percentage. Operating expenses increased by $6.3 billion, driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Gaming, and commercial sales. Overall, operating income increased by $13.5 billion, with an increase in all segments. Current year net income and diluted EPS were positively impacted by a net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, while prior year figures were positively impacted by a net tax benefit related to the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. Gross margin and operating income also included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.\n"
